; Developer feature enabling lists with duplicate values
: <div>

This plugin uses an internal drop-in replacement for the [[enlist|enlist Operator]] filter operator which is identical except that duplicate items are retained rather than discarded.

The replacement filter operator relies on a poorly documented feature of the <<.op "$tw.utils.parseStringArray()">> macro as defined in the <<.var boot/boot.js>> file. According to the release notes for Tiddlywiki version 5.1.18 ([[local|Release 5.1.18]], [[web|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Release%205.1.18]]), the //Developer Bug Fixes and Improvements// include:

<<<
[[Refactored|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/2027]] `$tw.utils.parseStringArray()` to optionally allow non-unique entries
<<<

The link in the release note is to the github pull request that altered  <<.op "$tw.utils.parseStringArray()">> to optionally return list values that retain duplicate items.

The replacement filter operator provided by this plugin makes use of this undocumented optional behaviour of <<.op "$tw.utils.parseStringArray()">>.

: <div>

The configuration tiddler provided as part of this plugin is [[$:/config/plugin/.dtn/insert-table/style-sets]].

The configuration tiddler is not necessary for inserting tables but is provided as a potential method of grouping together commonly used sets for css styles. (See [[plugin usage|$:/plugins/.dtn/insert-table/usage]] for details.)

The example style set provided in the configuration tiddler uses css styles from the [[Shiraz plugin|https://kookma.github.io/Shiraz/#%24%3A%2Fplugins%2F.mr%2Fshiraz%20plugin]].
